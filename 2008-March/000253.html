-------------------------------------------------------------
-  Release Notes for Transform SWF for Java, Version 2.1.
-------------------------------------------------------------
-
-This release brings forward a lot of changes discussed in the roadmap for 
-Version 3.0. The two most important ones are:
-
-Transform Utilities classes are included in the package structure.
-Lazy decoding of actions and shapes which brings huge performance gains.
-
-Other changes are mostly administrative, cleaning up code and generally 
-resolving minor technical issues and improving support and use of TestNG for 
-testing and verification.
-
-The project is also open to code contributed by other developers. A new 
-package transform.contrib is now included in the source tree for code not 
-covered by Flagstone's copyright. This package is open for any code which maybe 
-useful for developers - as long as it is compatible with the BSD licence.
-
-Bug Fixes          
-    FSPush: FSProperty objects are cloned correctly.     
-    FSTextConstructor handles file names in upper case.     
- 
-New Classes 
-    FSCharacterTable providing character sets for FSTextConstructor     
-    FSCoderException to handle and report encoding or decoding errors.     
-
-Class Changes   
-    FSMovieTest: Added methods to benchmark code performance.     
-    FSTransformObject: methods used to encode/decode classes are public.     
-    Added copy constructors on all classes.     
-    Removed redundant exception declarations.
-    Added the constructor public FSTextConstructor(int, Font).

- 
- 
--------------
-  Bug Fixes  
--------------
-
-1. FSPush: FSProperty objects are cloned correctly.  
-
-FSProperty objects are now copied into the cloned array. Previously the 
-cloned array &quot;dropped&quot; any FSPropert objects. 
-
-2. FSTextConstructor handles file names in upper case.  
-
-File names in upper case are now handled - this makes using TrueType files 
-from Windows systems much easier.
-
-
----------------
-  New Classes  
----------------
-
-1. FSCharacterTable providing character sets for FSTextConstructor  
-
-The willDisplay() method on FSTextConstructor (see below) is used to 
-define the characters that will be encoded in a font. The FSCharacterTable 
-class provided arrays of characters that can be used with the willDisplay
-method. Different character sets are provided for ISO 8859-1 as well as 
-characters for the main European languages. 
-
-2. FSCoderException to handle and report encoding or decoding errors.  
-
-Added a new exception class, FSCoderException to report when underflow or
-overflow errors occur when encoding or decoding objects. Previously only the 
-more general IOException was reported. FSCoderException contains information on 
-the location of the data structure in the file that caused the error making 
-diagnosis much easier.
-
------------------
-  Class Changes  
------------------
-
-1. FSMovieTest: Added methods to benchmark code performance.  
-
-Updated FSMovieTest.java to record the time taken to decode and encode
-Flash files. TestNG scripts for running the tests were added to the directory
-test\benchmarks. The benchmark tests use Flash files stored in the directories
-text\data\movies\swf&lt;x&gt;
-
-The benchmarks measure the time taken to decode or encode a given Flash file
-100 times and are best suited to measure relative improvements when optimizing 
-the code in the Transform classes.
-
-2. FSTransformObject: methods used to encode/decode classes are public.  
-
-The methods used to encode and decode objects:
-
-    int length(FSCoder)
-    void decode(FSCoder)
-    void encode(FSCoder)
-
-
-along with the constructor for each class that initialised an object with
-binary data decoded from an FSCoder object are all &quot;upgraded&quot; to public to 
-support testing with TestNG.
-
-3. Added copy constructors on all classes.  
-
-All classes now have copy constructors to complement the clone()
-method.
-
-4. Removed redundant exception declarations.  
-
-Removed redundant exceptions declarations from method signatures:
-FileNotFoundException is covered by IOException. Applies to FSMovie,
-FSSoundConstructor, FSImageConstructor. This change is simply aesthetic all the 
-removed exceptions are subclasses of IOException.
-
-5. Added the constructor public FSTextConstructor(int, Font).  
-
-FSTextConstructor had a single constructor FSTextConstructor(int, String)
-which was used to pass names of files and names of fonts. This new constructor
-was added to clearly differentiate fonts from files. Existing code is unaffected
-and will continue to operate in all future releases however use of this new
-method is encouraged when using AWT font definitions.
-
-6. FSTextConstructor: added reset method.  
-
-Added a reset(int) method to allow FSTextConstructor objects to be reused 
-when generating objects for more than one Flash file. The reset method clears
-the internal table used to track the order in which characters are used. This 
-allows the same FSTextConstructor object to be used to generate multiple font
-definitions. This is particularly useful when using AWT based fonts where the 
-time taken to decode the font definitions is relatively large.
-
-7. FSTextConstructor: added willDisplay method.  
-
-Added the method, willDisplay(char[]) to allow sets of characters to be 
-defined before creating any text objects.
-
-This solves the bug where characters were encoded in the order they were used 
-but not in ascending order of character code. This also simplifies using 
-FSTextConstructor class where previously text objects had to be defined before 
-the font definition was created.
-
-A corresponding canDisplay(char[]) method was added to verify that a given
-font can display all of the characters in a given set.
-
-8. Tidied up FSCoder class and deprecated FSCodec.  
-
-Tidied up the FSCoder class, making all methods more reliable and merging in
-functionality from Transform Utilities FSCodec. All decoding and encoding of 
-data is now performed using FSCoder. FSCodec is deprecated.
-
-9. TransformUtil is now deprecated.  
-
-with the merging of the Transform and Transform Utilities packages the 
-class TransformUtil is no longer required to provide basic version information
-and is now deprecated.
-
-10. Deprecated the FSMovieListener interface.  
-
-Deprecated the FSMovieListener interface, FSMovieEvent class and the methods 
-on the FSMovie class that used them.
-
-The FSMovieListener interface was originally used to support Describe. When 
-a movie was parsed the values decoded were reported to a FSMovieListener. This 
-allowed Describe to build a tree of objects so the contents of a Flash file 
-could be browsed.
-
-The interface also allowed errors to be reported so a file could be decoded 
-even if part of it was corrupted - some third-party tools are known to contain 
-bugs that generate errors. The Flash Player is robust when encountering this 
-type of error so the Movie Listener interface was an attempt to introduce 
-robustness into Transform.
-
-In practice the value of the interface was limited. Files containing errors
- which would cause errors were relatively unusual and when an error was detected 
- it was not obvious that recovering form the error was useful.
-
-
---------------------------
-  Internal Class Changes  
---------------------------
-
-1. Canonical objects are now used.  
-
-Added canonical version of objects that can be safely shared since they 
-contain no editable attributes. The classes affected are FSNull, FSVoid, 
-FSAction, FSCall, FSShowFrame and FSPathsArePostscript. The most significant is 
-FSAction which specifies byte-codes for stack-based actionsand so will boost 
-performance when decoding files. The numbers of objects involved for other
-classes are much smaller in comparison but are included for completeness.
-
-2. Added lazy decoding of shapes and actions.  
-
-Added lazy decoding of actions to FSButtonEvent, FSClipEvent, FSDoAction, 
-FSDefineButton and FSInitialize. The encoded actions will be stored in binary
-form in these objects until accessed using the getActions() or addAction()
-methods. When either of these methods are used the encoded actions will be 
-decoded into an array of FSAction objects. This reduces the number of objects
-created when a file is decoded so that only the actions accessed are decoded.
-
-Similarly for classes that define shapes. The array of FSLine, FSCurve and 
-FSShapeStyle objects are stored in binary form then decoded only when the array
-is accessed. The classes that define shapes are FSDefineShape, FSDefineShape2, 
-FSDefineShape3, FSDefineMorphShape, FSDefineFont and FSDefineFont2. Accessing
-shape objects is relatively unusual so lazy decoding speeds up processing by 
-only decoding objects that are used.
-
-Lazy decoding provides an enormous increase in performance. Benchmark tests
-when decoding files gave average performance increases of 15 times - with a 
-range between 0 and 420 times. Larger files gave larger performance gains.
-
-This is particularly important when using existing Flash files as a 
-template for customization. Simply replacing images, text and sound in a file
-does not typically need font glyphs and shapes to be decoded and using lazy 
-decoding can dramatically increase performance.
-
-Lazy decoding and encoding does not require any API changes.
-
-3. Improved decoding of JPEG image data.  
-
-Improved the algorithm when decoding the encoding table in the classes
-FSDefineJPEGImage2 and FSDefineJPEGImage3. The encoding table is now processed 
-correctly, even when the encoding table is empty and the start of image (SOI) 
-and end of image (EOI) markers are incorrectly specified.
-
-
--------------------
-  Package Changes  
--------------------
-
-1. Merged Transform and Tranform Utilities.
-
-Merged the classes from Transform Utilities into the Transform framework to 
-create a single release. All future releases will include the Utilities classes.
-Transform Utilities will no longer be released as a separate framework.
-
-Consequently the class, TransformUtil, which contains version number 
-information is deprecated and will be dropped in Transform 2.2.
-
-2. Added a package for contributed code.
-
-A new package transform.contrib is included for code from third-parties
-that can be used with the classes in the Transform framework but which is not 
-subject to the same licencing terms or copyright ownership.
-
-Contributed code can be found in the directory src/transform/contrib. Any 
-code may be contributed to the project as long as it is compatible with the 
-terms of the BSD licence. All rights are retained by the author(s). Flagstone 
-specifically disclaims any rights to the code.
-
-The first contributed class is the code to compress WAV files to ADPCM. The 
-code is a Java port of C code released by Jack Jansen, Stichting Mathematisch 
-Centrum, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This code was previously available on the 
-Flagstone web site and will now be included in future releases.

+-------------
+  Bug Fixes  
+-------------
+
+1. Clip events are not re-encoded correctly.
+
+When the code was updated in release 2.1.6 to handle cases where end of action
+markers were encountered in the middle of an array of actions (which caused 
+decoded to terminate prematurely) a bug was introduced in the way FSClipEvent
+objects were encoded: the offset to the end of the clip event was mis-calculated
+by one byte causing the encoded movie not to play correctly. This is now fixed.
+
+2. Cannot decode WAV files with odd number of bytes in data.
+
+WAV files that end with a DATA block which contains an odd number of bytes can
+now be decoded correctly by the FSSoundConstructor.
+
+3. Cannot decode clip events generated by Flash CS3.
+
+There is an internal field in FSClipEvent that gives the offset to either the
+next event or to the end of the event array. In Flash CS3 the offset appears to
+be incorrect. Instead of the offset being set to the length of the actions for 
+the handler it is 1 byte larger. The code in the FSClipEvent has been updated
+to test for this condition allowing files to be decoded.
+    
+4.Font definitions with no name do not decode.
+
+Font objects (FSFontInfo, FSFontInfo2, FSDefineFont2) contain a field for the 
+font name. In releas 2.1.6 code was added to remove trailing null bytes but the
+code did not test for cases where the font name was not set. This is now fixed.
+
+-----------------
+  Class Changes  
+-----------------
+
+1. FSCoder no longer throws IllegalArgumentExceptions on pointer overflows.
+
+If the internal pointer used in the FSCoder class to mark the current position 
+in the data buffer is moved beyond the end of the buffer an IllegalArgumentException
+is no longer thrown. Instead the position of the pointer is clamped to the end 
+of the buffer. Any attempt to read the data will return zero. Read errors can
+be detected by checking whether the expected number of bytes were read by comparing
+the pointer value at the start and end of reading a block of data.
+
+This is an internal change and will not have any impact unless you use the 
+FSCoder class directly to decode blocks of data.

-  
--------------
-  Bug Fixes  
--------------
-
-12776. NAME block in TrueType fonts is not decoded correctly.
-
-The NAME block in TrueType font files which contains the name of the font, 
-copyright information and other font related strings is now decoded correctly.
-
-12769. JPEG SOI and EOI markers are swapped on null encoding tables.
-
-The readJPEGStream methods in FSDefineJPEG2 and FSDefineJPEG3 was updated and 
-the classes are now better able to decode encoding tables where the Start of 
-Image (SOI) and End of Image (EOI) markers are reversed.
-
-In FSDefineJPEG2 the order of the markers when specifying a NULL encoding table
-was incorrectly reversed. The correct order, 0xFFD8 (SOI), 0xFFD9 (EOI) is now
-used.
-
-12768. Font name in FSDefineFont2, FSFontInfo[2] has trailing null.
-
-The trailing null byte that was used to terminate the string in the FSDefineFont2, 
-FSFontInfo and FSFontInfo2 classes has now been removed.
-
-12747. Leading in FSDefineTextField is decoded as unsigned.
-
-The leading field, which defines the spacing between lines is now correctly 
-decoded as a signed integer.
-
-12730. FSSerialNumber does not decode if string contains null.
-
-If a serial number contains a null byte in the middle of the string it will 
-still be decoded correctly.
-
-12729. FSProtect will not decode Flash 4 files with passwords.
-
-Flash 4 files containing a Protect data structure with an MD5 encoded password
-are now decoded correctly.
-
-12728. FSProtect does not decode if string contains null.
-
-If a password string contains a null byte in the middle of the string it will 
-still be decoded correctly.
-
-9806. Transform cannot handle obfuscated actions.
-
-The decoding of actions in FSButtonEvent, FSClipEvent, FSDefineButton, 
-FSDoAction and FSInitialize is now able to handle causes where End of Action
-markers (0x00) are injected into the sequences of actions - perhaps as an 
-obfuscation technique to prematurely stop the decoding of actions.
-
------------------
-  Class Changes  
------------------
-
-1. Equals method added to FSCoder.
-
-A method, boolean equals(Object obj), was added to FSCoder to support unit 
-testing.
-
-2. Increased compression buffer on FSImageConstructor.
-
-Increase the buffer spaced used during compression of images for the rare 
-occasion where the compressed image is larger than the original.
-
-3. Equals on FSDefineImage and FSDefineImage2 compares uncompressed images.
-
-The equals method on FSDefineImage and FSDefineImage2 now unzips the compressed
-images before comparing objects. This allows objects that contain identical 
-images but which were compressed with different parameters to pass as being 
-equal.
-
-This change was introduced primarily for testing to compare images created 
-by the Flash authoring tool to be compared with images compressed by the 
-Transform framework.
-
--------------------
-  Testing Changes  
--------------------
-
-1. JUnit replaces TestNG.
-
-The classes used to unit test the framework were refactored to use JUnit. While
-TestNG is probably the more powerful of the two the simplicity and ease of use 
-of JUnit is hard to beat, especially since there is good support for executing 
-tests from within IDEs such as Eclipse.
-
-2. Testing is simplified.
-
-With the adoption of JUnit the approach to testing has been simplified. Testing 
-is now a simple pass/fail approach with the JUnit tests used to verify changes 
-made to the framework. This is ideal to verify correct operation of the classes,
-for example when testing different image or sound files or for verifying changes
-when submitting bug fixes.
-
-More detailed testing, particularly for significant changes to the way files 
-are encoded or decoded is now handled by a separate project where the way objects
-are encoded is verified using the Flash authoring tool as a reference.
-
--------------------
-  Package Changes  
--------------------
-
-1. Releases simplified.
-
-Releases of the framework now only include documentation, jar file and source
-for the framework classes, contributed classes and examples. The goal is to
-strip down releases so they are easier to use within other projects. All the 
-files used to debug and test the framework  are still available from the 
-Subversion repository: <A HREF="https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/transform/trunk">https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/transform/trunk</A>
-
-2. Tools package was removed.
-
-With the simplification of the way the framework is tested the TextDump class
-was no longer used and the package was removed from the release. If this causes
-any inconvenience please contact Flagstone.

-
-In previous releases the 't' was missing from 'Unity' i.e. isUniyTransform. This 
-is now corrected to isUnityTransform.
-
-2. Trailing null byte is now removed from password string in FSProtect.

-Accessor methods to get the width and height of a JPEG encoded image are 
-added to the FSDefineJPEGImage, FSDefineJPEGImage2 and FSDefineJPEGImage3
-classes.
-
-    public int getWidth();
-    public int getHeight();
-
-No set methods are added, the width and height are decoded from the image data 
-whenver the object is decoded or the setImage() method is used.

-2. FSShapeConstructor - polygon() now handles absolute coordinates.
-
-The coordinates passed to the polygon(int[]) method on FSShapeConstructor are 
-now absolute. A new method rpolygon(int[]) was added to allow polygons to be 
-drawn using relative coordinates.
-
-3. FSFrame - a new class for organising the time-line within movies.
-
-FSFrame is an upgraded version of the Frame class currently available on the 
-Useful Code page with the addition of a frame number attribute. 
-
-Grouping together all the objects associated with a frame simplifies greatly the 
-task of creation and editing a movie. However supported numbered frames becomes
-really useful when combined with the new FSLayer class.
-
-4. FSLayer - a new class for organising the animation of objects within movies.
-
-Currently all the objects must be created and positioned for successive frames.
-This makes creating of complex animations with Transform next to impossible 
-without careful coding.
-
-With the FSLayer class, separate time-lines can be created for each object. With
-each frame numbered using the FSFrame class all the layers can easily be aligned 
-and flattened to create the final animation. 
-
-5. FSHeader - a new class for just getting information about a flash file.
-
-FSHeader decodes the header block of a flash file that contains the following 
-information about a movie:
-
-    signature, indicates whether a file was compressed &quot;CWS&quot; or not &quot;FWS&quot;.
-	version, the version of Flash used.
-	length, the length of the movie in bytes when uncompressed.
- 	minX, the x-coordinate of the top left corner of the screen.
- 	maxX, the x-coordinate of the bottom right corner of the screen.
- 	minY, the y-coordinate of the top left corner of the screen.
- 	maxY, the y-coordinate of the bottom right corner of the screen.
- 	frameRate, the rate at which the movie is played, in frames per second.
- 	frameCount, the number of frames in the movie.
- 	
-FSHeader only the header information is decoded, the rest of the data structures 
-are ignored so the class can be used to get the attributes of a movie without
-paying the penalty of using FSMovie where all the data structures are decoded.
-
--------------------------
-  Documentation Changes  
--------------------------
-
-1. FSPlaceObject2 - corrected documentation on setting the morph ratio.
-
-The javadoc comments on methods that set the morph ratio for an object specified
-the range as 0..65535, this is the actual number encoded in the Flash file 
-however Transform uses a floating point value in the range 0..1 which is more 
-intuitive to use - the value in converted when the object is encoded or decoded.
-The documentation was updated to refer to the floating point range.

+  Class Changes  
+-----------------
+
+1. New classes for handling Flash Video.
+
+Four new classes have been added to decode and encode Flash Video files.
+
+   FSVideoObject - an abstract parent class similar to FSMovieObject.
+   FSVideo - a collection class similar to FSMovie.
+   FSAudioData - contains the encoded audio.
+   FSVideoData - contains the encoded video.
+   
+The classes provide basic information on the format used to encode the audio
+and video streams and provide access to the binary data - no encoding or 
+decoding is performed.
