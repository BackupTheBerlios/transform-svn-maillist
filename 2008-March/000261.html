-Four new classes have been added to decode and encode Flash Video files.
-
-   FSVideoObject - an abstract parent class similar to FSMovieObject.

-   
-The classes provide basic information on the format used to encode the audio
-and video streams and provide access to the binary data - no encoding or 
-decoding is performed.

-  Release Notes for Transform SWF, Version 3.0. 
--------------------------------------------------
-
-IMPORTANT: This document contains the set of proposed changes for version 3.0 
-of the Transfrom SWF framework. This document will be updated regularly and 
-everything is, of course, subject to change.
- 
-Introduction
-Over the past year I have been involved in projects that used existing Flash 
-files as a template. Transform was used to decode the file then update or 
-replace objects to create a customised version.
-
-The changes proposed for Transform 3.0 will update the code to include all 
-the lessons learned from this work and also generally clean up the code base - 
-fixing mistakes, dumb decisions and generally making the framework easier to 
-use.
-
-Architecturally the changes should be minor - the same philosophy of 
-providing a low-level API which exposes all the data structures in a Flash file 
-as objects will be maintained. Files will still be generated and parsed in the 
-same way. Most of the changes will essentially be cosmetic - fixing code that 
-simply bad or poorly implemented. As a result migrating code from Transform 2 
-to Transform 3 should be very simple and extensive rewrites will not be 
-necessary.
-
-Class Changes
-
-    Flatten class hierarchy and use interfaces to identify object types.
-    Enforce encapsulation and add support for references.
-    Add factory methods.
-    More use of Java 'native' classes.
-    
-    Rename existing classes:
-    
-        Rename FSGradient to FSGradientColor.
-        Rename FSEnvelope to FSSoundLevel.
-        Rename FSShapeStyle to FSStyle.
-        Rename FSUnknownObject to FSBinaryObject.
-
-    New Classes:
-
-        FSScript - a wrapper for encoded actions generated by Translate.
-        FSEnvelope - a collection class for FSSoundLevels.
-        FSGradient - a collection class for FSGradientColors.
-        FSGlyph - a collection class for font information.
-
-Internal Class Changes
-
-    To be defined
-
-Package Changes
-
-    None planned.
-
-
------------------
-  Class Changes
------------------
-
-1. Flatten class hierarchy and use interfaces to identify object types.
-
-In short the current class hierarchy: 
-
-    FSTransformObject -&gt; FSMovieObject -&gt; FSDefineObject 
-    
-adds very little to the project. Code reuse is minimal and the overhead slows 
-down the encoding and decoding of files.
-
-To fix this the hierarchy will be flattened to a single level. For code that 
-need to identify where an object was a definition or a display list command Java 
-interfaces will be used to effectively create types of object. For example 
-rather than inheriting from FSTransformObject objects will implement the 
-FSTransformable interface which defines where an object knows how to encode and 
-decode itself from binary data.
-
-Examples of the interfaces that will be defined include:
-
-    public interface Transformable
-    {
-        public int decode(FSCoder coder);
-        public void precode(FSCoder coder);
-        public int encode(FSCoder coder);
-    }
-
-    public interface MovieObject
-    {
-        public int getType();
-        public boolean isDefinition();
-        public boolean isShape();
-        public boolean isImage();
-        public boolean isSound();
-        public boolean isFont();
-        public boolean isText();
-    }
-    
-    public interface DefinitionObject
-    {
-        public int getIdentifier();
-        public void setIdentifier(int identifier);
-    }
-
-The methods, of course, is all subject to change should a better idea come 
-to light.
-
-
-2. Enforce encapsulation and add support for references.
-
-Flash files are simply large data structures. An object in Transform is 
-simply a data structure that knows how to encode and decode itself. As a result 
-a deliberate decision was taken to break encapsulation and support accessor 
-methods that simply used references rather than copies. This avoided the 
-overhead of creating trees of objects whenever the objects in a Flash file were 
-traversed. Enforcing encapsulation would have required creating several trees 
-of objects as the graph was traversed to change for example a small-grained 
-object such as a shape's colour.
-
-The move to use lazily decoded arrays potentially requires encapsulation to 
-be enforced since it would make it explicitly clear when an array of objects 
-was modified and required encoding when a files was saved.
-
-For the 3.0 release the default policy will most likely be that normal 
-get/set accessor methods create copies of objects. Methods will be added to 
-return references so that excessive copying when traversing the object tree is 
-avoided.
-
-
-3. Add factory methods.
-
-Constructors for simple objects such as shape definitions and some display 
-list commands are easy to use. However for multipurpose objects which have 
-optional attributes including constructors for every option is tedious and 
-confusing, FSPlaceObject2 is the obvious culprit. The basic set of constructors
-was standardised in version 2.1. For version 3.0 the factory methods will be
-updated.
-
-
-4. More use of Java 'native' classes.
-
-The FSMovie class is the obvious example of how classes in Transform fail to 
-make use of Java classes. Rather than using File objects the names of Flash 
-files are presented using Strings - which are used internally to create File 
-objects. This situation arose as I wanted to keep the API for the Java and C++ 
-versions as close as possible to minimise the effort of maintaining the code - 
-a poor decision. So Transform 3.0 will make better use of Java objects to provide 
-a more 'natural' API.
-
-
-5. Rename existing classes.
-
-With a new version comes a chance to clean up and ugliness. The following 
-classes will be renamed to make their role clearer and hopefully more intuitive:
-
-Rename FSGradient to FSGradientColor to support the new FSGradient collection 
-class for FSGradientColours - specifying how the colour of a shape changes 
-across the Gradient Square.
-
-Rename FSEnvelope to FSSoundLevel to support the new FSEnvelope collection class 
-for a FSSoundLevels which describes the waveform applied to a sound.
-
-Rename FSShapeStyle to FSStyle - easier to type.
-
-Rename FSUnknownObject to FSBinaryObject - binary objects can be used explicitly 
-by Transform Utilities classes to generate encoded version of objects.
-
- 
-6. New Classes
-
-The new classes that will be added in Transform 3.0 are designed to support 
-lazy decoding of arrays of small-grained objects.  FSScript, FSEnvelope, 
-FSGradient are  simple collection classes.
-
-FSGlyph is more complicated as it will support all the information that 
-describes a font glyph: shape, advance, character code and bounding box. This 
-will simply the use of the FSTextConstructor class in Tranform Utilities and 
-handling of the FSDefineFont2 class in Transform.
