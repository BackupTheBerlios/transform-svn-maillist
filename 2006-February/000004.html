+
+Copyright FAQ
+=============
+
+   1. I don't understand the resale restriction... What gives?
+
+      Bitstream is giving away these fonts, but wishes to ensure its
+      competitors can't just drop the fonts as is into a font sale system
+      and sell them as is. It seems fair that if Bitstream can't make money
+      from the Bitstream Vera fonts, their competitors should not be able to
+      do so either. You can sell the fonts as part of any software package,
+      however.
+
+   2. I want to package these fonts separately for distribution and
+      sale as part of a larger software package or system.  Can I do so?
+
+      Yes. A RPM or Debian package is a &quot;larger software package&quot; to begin 
+      with, and you aren't selling them independently by themselves. 
+      See 1. above.
+
+   3. Are derivative works allowed?
+      Yes!
+
+   4. Can I change or add to the font(s)?
+      Yes, but you must change the name(s) of the font(s).
+
+   5. Under what terms are derivative works allowed?
+
+      You must change the name(s) of the fonts. This is to ensure the
+      quality of the fonts, both to protect Bitstream and Gnome. We want to
+      ensure that if an application has opened a font specifically of these
+      names, it gets what it expects (though of course, using fontconfig,
+      substitutions could still could have occurred during font
+      opening). You must include the Bitstream copyright. Additional
+      copyrights can be added, as per copyright law. Happy Font Hacking!
+
+   6. If I have improvements for Bitstream Vera, is it possible they might get 
+       adopted in future versions?
+
+      Yes. The contract between the Gnome Foundation and Bitstream has
+      provisions for working with Bitstream to ensure quality additions to
+      the Bitstream Vera font family. Please contact us if you have such
+      additions. Note, that in general, we will want such additions for the
+      entire family, not just a single font, and that you'll have to keep
+      both Gnome and Jim Lyles, Vera's designer, happy! To make sense to add
+      glyphs to the font, they must be stylistically in keeping with Vera's
+      design. Vera cannot become a &quot;ransom note&quot; font. Jim Lyles will be
+      providing a document describing the design elements used in Vera, as a
+      guide and aid for people interested in contributing to Vera.
+
+   7. I want to sell a software package that uses these fonts: Can I do so?
+
+      Sure. Bundle the fonts with your software and sell your software
+      with the fonts. That is the intent of the copyright.
+
+   8. If applications have built the names &quot;Bitstream Vera&quot; into them, 
+      can I override this somehow to use fonts of my choosing?
+
+      This depends on exact details of the software. Most open source
+      systems and software (e.g., Gnome, KDE, etc.) are now converting to
+      use fontconfig (see www.fontconfig.org) to handle font configuration,
+      selection and substitution; it has provisions for overriding font
+      names and subsituting alternatives. An example is provided by the
+      supplied local.conf file, which chooses the family Bitstream Vera for
+      &quot;sans&quot;, &quot;serif&quot; and &quot;monospace&quot;.  Other software (e.g., the XFree86
+      core server) has other mechanisms for font substitution.

+Bitstream Vera Fonts - April 16, 2003
+=====================================
+
+The version number of these fonts is 1.10 to distinguish them from the
+beta test fonts.
+
+Note that the Vera copyright is incorporated in the fonts themselves.
+The License field in the fonts contains the copyright license as it
+appears below. The TrueType copyright field is not large enough to
+contain the full license, so the license is incorporated (as you might
+think if you thought about it) into the license field, which
+unfortunately can be obscure to find.  (In pfaedit, see: Element-&gt;Font
+Info-&gt;TTFNames-&gt;License).
+
+Our apologies for it taking longer to complete the fonts than planned.
+Beta testers requested a tighter line spacing (less leading) and Jim
+Lyles redesigned Vera's accents to bring its line spacing to more
+typical of other fonts.  This took additional time and effort.  Our
+thanks to Jim for this effort above and beyond the call of duty.
+
+There are four monospace and sans faces (normal, oblique, bold, bold
+oblique) and two serif faces (normal and bold). Fontconfig/Xft2 (see
+www.fontconfig.org) can artificially oblique the serif faces for you:
+this loses hinting and distorts the faces slightly, but is visibly
+different than normal and bold, and reasonably pleasing.
+
+On systems with fontconfig 2.0 or 2.1 installed, making your sans,
+serif and monospace fonts default to these fonts is very easy.  Just
+drop the file local.conf into your /etc/fonts directory.  This will
+make the Bitstream fonts your default fonts for all applications using
+fontconfig (if sans, serif, or monospace names are used, as they often
+are as default values in many desktops). The XML in local.conf may
+need modification to enable subpixel decimation, if appropriate,
+however, the commented out phrase does so for XFree86 4.3, in the case
+that the server does not have sufficient information to identify the
+use of a flat panel.  Fontconfig 2.2 adds Vera to the list of font
+families and will, by default use it as the default sans, serif and
+monospace fonts.
+
+During the testing of the final Vera fonts, we learned that screen
+fonts in general are only typically hinted to work correctly at
+integer pixel sizes.  Vera is coded internally for integer sizes only.
+We need to investigate further to see if there are commonly used fonts
+that are hinted to be rounded but are not rounded to integer sizes due
+to oversights in their coding.
+
+Most fonts work best at 8 pixels and below if anti-aliased only, as
+the amount of work required to hint well at smaller and smaller sizes
+becomes astronomical.  GASP tables are typically used to control
+whether hinting is used or not, but Freetype/Xft does not currently
+support GASP tables (which are present in Vera).
+
+To mitigate this problem, both for Vera and other fonts, there will be
+(very shortly) a new fontconfig 2.2 release that will, by default not
+apply hints if the size is below 8 pixels. if you should have a font
+that in fact has been hinted more agressively, you can use fontconfig
+to note this exception. We believe this should improve many hinted
+fonts in addition to Vera, though implemeting GASP support is likely
+the right long term solution.
+
+Font rendering in Gnome or KDE is the combination of algorithms in
+Xft2 and Freetype, along with hinting in the fonts themselves. It is
+vital to have sufficient information to disentangle problems that you
+may observe.
+
+Note that having your font rendering system set up correctly is vital
+to proper judgement of problems of the fonts:
+
+    * Freetype may or may not be configured to in ways that may
+      implement execution of possibly patented (in some parts of the world)
+      TrueType hinting algorithms, particularly at small sizes.  Best
+      results are obtained while using these algorithms.
+
+    * The freetype autohinter (used when the possibly patented
+      algorithms are not used) continues to improve with each release. If
+      you are using the autohinter, please ensure you are using an up to
+      date version of freetype before reporting problems.
+
+    * Please identify what version of freetype you are using in any
+      bug reports, and how your freetype is configured.
+
+    * Make sure you are not using the freetype version included in
+      XFree86 4.3, as it has bugs that significantly degrade most fonts,
+      including Vera. if you build XFree86 4.3 from source yourself, you may
+      have installed this broken version without intending it (as I
+      did). Vera was verified with the recently released Freetype 2.1.4. On
+      many systems, 'ldd&quot; can be used to see which freetype shared library
+      is actually being used.
+
+    * Xft/X Render does not (yet) implement gamma correction.  This
+      causes significant problems rendering white text on a black background
+      (causing partial pixels to be insufficiently shaded) if the gamma of
+      your monitor has not been compensated for, and minor problems with
+      black text on a while background.  The program &quot;xgamma&quot; can be used to
+      set a gamma correction value in the X server's color pallette. Most
+      monitors have a gamma near 2.
+
+    * Note that the Vera family uses minimal delta hinting. Your
+      results on other systems when not used anti-aliased may not be
+      entirely satisfying. We are primarily interested in reports of
+      problems on open source systems implementing Xft2/fontconfig/freetype
+      (which implements antialiasing and hinting adjustements, and
+      sophisticated subpixel decimation on flatpanels).  Also, the
+      algorithms used by Xft2 adjust the hints to integer widths and the
+      results are crisper on open source systems than on Windows or
+      MacIntosh.
+
+    * Your fontconfig may (probably does) predate the release of
+      fontconfig 2.2, and you may see artifacts not present when the font is
+      used at very small sizes with hinting enabled. &quot;vc-list -V&quot; can be
+      used to see what version you have installed.
+
+We believe and hope that these fonts will resolve the problems
+reported during beta test.  The largest change is the reduction of
+leading (interline spacing), which had annoyed a number of people, and
+reduced Vera's utility for some applcations.  The Vera monospace font
+should also now make '0' and 'O' and '1' and 'l' more clearly
+distinguishable.
+
+The version of these fonts is version 1.10.  Fontconfig should be
+choosing the new version of the fonts if both the released fonts and
+beta test fonts are installed (though please discard them: they have
+names of form tt20[1-12]gn.ttf).  Note that older versions of
+fontconfig sometimes did not rebuild their cache correctly when new
+fonts are installed: please upgrade to fontconfig 2.2. &quot;fc-cache -f&quot;
+can be used to force rebuilding fontconfig's cache files.
+
+If you note problems, please send them to fonts at gnome dot org, with
+exactly which face and size and unicode point you observe the problem
+at. The xfd utility from XFree86 CVS may be useful for this (e.g. &quot;xfd
+-fa sans&quot;).  A possibly more useful program to examine fonts at a
+variety of sizes is the &quot;waterfall&quot; program found in Keith Packard's
+CVS.
+
+        $ cvs -d :pserver:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/transform-svn">anoncvs at keithp.com</A>:/local/src/CVS login
+        Logging in to :pserver:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/transform-svn">anoncvs at keithp.com</A>:2401/local/src/CVS
+        CVS password: &lt;hit return&gt;
+        $ cvs -d :pserver:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/transform-svn">anoncvs at keithp.com</A>:/local/src/CVS co waterfall
+        $ cd waterfall
+        $ xmkmf -a
+        $ make
+        # make install
+        # make install.man
+
+Again, please make sure you are running an up-to-date freetype, and
+that you are only examining integer sizes.
+
+Reporting Problems
+==================
+
+Please send problem reports to fonts at gnome org, with the following
+information:
+
+   1. Version of Freetype, Xft2 and fontconfig
+   2. Whether TT hinting is being used, or the autohinter
+   3. Application being used
+   4. Character/Unicode code point that has problems (if applicable)
+   5. Version of which operating system
+   6. Please include a screenshot, when possible.
+
+Please check the fonts list archives before reporting problems to cut
+down on duplication.
