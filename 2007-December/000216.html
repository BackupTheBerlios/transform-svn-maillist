+------------------------------------------------------------
+  Release Notes for Transform SWF for Java, Version 2.1.6.
+------------------------------------------------------------
+
+The release fixes a number of bugs and improves reliability when dealing with
+file that are &quot;outside&quot; of the Flash specification. Testing is now carried out 
+using JUnit and way each release is packaged was simplified.
+
+Bug Fixes
+    12776. NAME block in TrueType fonts is not decoded correctly.
+    12769. JPEG SOI and EOI markers are swapped on null encoding tables.
+    12768. Font name in FSDefineFont2, FSFontInfo[2] has trailing null.
+    12747. Leading in FSDefineTextField is decoded as unsigned.
+    12730. FSSerialNumber does not decode if string contains null.
+    12729. FSProtect will not decode Flash 4 files with passwords.
+    12728. FSProtect does not decode if string contains null.
+     9806. Transform cannot handle obfuscated actions.
+
+Class Changes
+    Equals method added to FSCoder.
+    Increased compression buffer on FSImageConstructor.
+    Equals on FSDefineImage and FSDefineImage2 compares uncompressed images.
+    
+Testing Changes
+    JUnit replaces TestNG
+    Testing is simplified
+    
+Package Changes
+    Releases simplified.
+    Tools package was removed.
+  
+-------------
+  Bug Fixes  
+-------------
+
+12776. NAME block in TrueType fonts is not decoded correctly.
+
+The NAME block in TrueType font files which contains the name of the font, 
+copyright information and other font related strings is now decoded correctly.
+
+12769. JPEG SOI and EOI markers are swapped on null encoding tables.
+
+The readJPEGStream methods in FSDefineJPEG2 and FSDefineJPEG3 was updated and 
+the classes are now better able to decode encoding tables where the Start of 
+Image (SOI) and End of Image (EOI) markers are reversed.
+
+In FSDefineJPEG2 the order of the markers when specifying a NULL encoding table
+was incorrectly reversed. The correct order, 0xFFD8 (SOI), 0xFFD9 (EOI) is now
+used.
+
+12768. Font name in FSDefineFont2, FSFontInfo[2] has trailing null.
+
+The trailing null byte that was used to terminate the string in the FSDefineFont2, 
+FSFontInfo and FSFontInfo2 classes has now been removed.
+
+12747. Leading in FSDefineTextField is decoded as unsigned.
+
+The leading field, which defines the spacing between lines is now correctly 
+decoded as a signed integer.
+
+12730. FSSerialNumber does not decode if string contains null.
+
+If a serial number contains a null byte in the middle of the string it will 
+still be decoded correctly.
+
+12729. FSProtect will not decode Flash 4 files with passwords.
+
+Flash 4 files containing a Protect data structure with an MD5 encoded password
+are now decoded correctly.
+
+12728. FSProtect does not decode if string contains null.
+
+If a password string contains a null byte in the middle of the string it will 
+still be decoded correctly.
+
+9806. Transform cannot handle obfuscated actions.
+
+The decoding of actions in FSButtonEvent, FSClipEvent, FSDefineButton, 
+FSDoAction and FSInitialize is now able to handle causes where End of Action
+markers (0x00) are injected into the sequences of actions - perhaps as an 
+obfuscation technique to prematurely stop the decoding of actions.
+
+-----------------
+  Class Changes  
+-----------------
+
+1. Equals method added to FSCoder.
+
+A method, boolean equals(Object obj), was added to FSCoder to support unit 
+testing.
+
+2. Increased compression buffer on FSImageConstructor.
+
+Increase the buffer spaced used during compression of images for the rare 
+occasion where the compressed image is larger than the original.
+
+3. Equals on FSDefineImage and FSDefineImage2 compares uncompressed images.
+
+The equals method on FSDefineImage and FSDefineImage2 now unzips the compressed
+images before comparing objects. This allows objects that contain identical 
+images but which were compressed with different parameters to pass as being 
+equal.
+
+This change was introduced primarily for testing to compare images created 
+by the Flash authoring tool to be compared with images compressed by the 
+Transform framework.
+
+-------------------
+  Testing Changes  
+-------------------
+
+1. JUnit replaces TestNG.
+
+The classes used to unit test the framework were refactored to use JUnit. While
+TestNG is probably the more powerful of the two the simplicity and ease of use 
+of JUnit is hard to beat, especially since there is good support for executing 
+tests from within IDEs such as Eclipse.
+
+2. Testing is simplified.
+
+With the adoption of JUnit the approach to testing has been simplified. Testing 
+is now a simple pass/fail approach with the JUnit tests used to verify changes 
+made to the framework. This is ideal to verify correct operation of the classes,
+for example when testing different image or sound files or for verifying changes
+when submitting bug fixes.
+
+More detailed testing, particularly for significant changes to the way files 
+are encoded or decoded is now handled by a separate project where the way objects
+are encoded is verified using the Flash authoring tool as a reference.
+
+-------------------
+  Package Changes  
+-------------------
+
+1. Releases simplified.
+
+Releases of the framework now only include documentation, jar file and source
+for the framework classes, contributed classes and examples. The goal is to
+strip down releases so they are easier to use within other projects. All the 
+files used to debug and test the framework  are still available from the 
+Subversion repository: <A HREF="https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/transform/trunk">https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/transform/trunk</A>
+
+2. Tools package was removed.
+
+With the simplification of the way the framework is tested the TextDump class
+was no longer used and the package was removed from the release. If this causes
+any inconvenience please contact Flagstone.
