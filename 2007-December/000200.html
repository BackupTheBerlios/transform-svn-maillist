   Testing the Framework
 -------------------------
-Transform comes with code to test that the classes in the framework are encoding
-and decoding Flash files correctly. The tests use the TestNG framework developed 
-by Cedric Beust, <A HREF="http://www.testng.org.">http://www.testng.org.</A>
+If you check out Transform from the repository then the source tree contains
+code to test that the classes in the framework are encoding and decoding Flash
+files correctly. The tests use JUnit 3.8.2 framework, which you can find out
+more about at <A HREF="http://www.junit.org.">http://www.junit.org.</A> Testing is designed to be performed within
+an development environment, such as Eclipse, where the unit tests can be run
+directly. The Junit JAR file is not included.
 
-The lib directory of the release contains the jar files neccessary to run the
-TestNG suites. Two versions of TestNG are available for Java 1.4 and Java 1.5
-depending on which version of Java you are using.
+The package com.flagstone.transform.test contains tests for individual classes
+as well as suites of tests for groups of classes. The class AllTests will run
+the entire suite of tests available.
 
-The Ant build file, test.xml, contains the following targets to run the tests:
-
-	clean-test  delete all the test reports and any directories generated when
-	            running the tests.
-	           
-	build-test  compile the test classes.
-	
-    test-all    run a full test of all the classes in the framework.
-    test-class  run unit tests for a specific class.
-    
-The reports generated by TestNG are written to the directory test/reports. A 
-separate directroy is created for each test and is named after the class being
-test while the report generated while testing the entire framework is written
-to the directory, Transform.
-
 ---------------------------
   Using Files For Testing
 ---------------------------
 The directory test/data is designed to hold sets of files that can be used to
 test the classes in the framework. The files augment the test patterns in the
-unit tests. This is particularly important for more complex classes such as 
-images, fonts and sounds where the volume and/or variation in data can be 
+unit tests. This is particularly important for more complex classes such as
