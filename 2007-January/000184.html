+-------------
+
+9717. FSDefineJPEGImage[2,3] does not handle multiple SOI tags.
+
+The classes FSDefineJPEGImage2 and FSDefineJPEGImage3 contain an encoding 
+table. The readJPEGStream method in each class is used to search for the 
+Start of Image and End of Image tags that delimit the table. When it detects a 
+start of image tag it marks the position as the start of the encoding table. A 
+second Start of Image causes the start position to advance. However the size of 
+the image is calculated from the encoded length - the size of the encoding 
+table. This caused the decoding to overflow and an exception was thrown.
+
+9718. FSShapeConstructor cannot draw small circles in pixels.
+
+The FSShapeConstructor allows drawing to be performed using coordinates and 
+sizes specified in pixels rather than twips. A bug in the method that draws 
+ellipses resulted in distorted shapes when specifying values in pixels. The 
+problem was caused by rounding errors in the equations for calculating the 
+curves to draw. This is now fixed.
+
+9797. Cannot decode multiple end of action markers in FSDoAction.
+
+In the flash file format specification published my Macromedia/Adobe arrays 
+of actions are terminated with a zero byte. However in Flash 7 and later more 
+than one zero byte can be used to signal the end of the array.
+
+Transform only checks for a single end of action marker before stopping. The 
+result that for objects such as FSDoAction the number of bytes decoded is less 
+than the number specified in the object header and so an FSCoderException is 
+thrown.
+
+To fix this a new Action, End, was added to the FSAction class. All but the last 
+End of Action marker are decoded as this action. This preserves the original
+format of the actions when reencoded while at the same time keeps compatibility
+with existing code.
+
+9805. Overflow error when decoding ButtonSounds.
+
+When decoding a ButtonSound data structure (which defines how the sounds will
+be played when different events occur in a button) an FSCoderException is thrown 
+to report that an overflow error occurred.
+
+The root cause appears to be a violation of the flash file format specification 
+as presented by Adobe/Macromedia. The specification states that the way a sound 
+is played can be defined for 4 button events: rollOut, rollOver, press and 
+release. If a sound is not played when an event occurs then 0x0000 is encoded. 
+However in ButtonSound objects where no sound will be played for the release 
+event nothing is encoded instead of writing 0x0000.
+
+The problem is easy to fix however. The FSSound objects decoded from the 
+ButtonSound data structures are treated as optional. This allows the sound 
+information for the release event to be treated as optional and so the overflow 
+error is avoided.
+
+9807. Latency attribute for MP3 Sounds is optional.
+
+The FSSoundStreamHead and FSSoundStreamHead2 classes contain a latency 
+attribute for MP3 encoded sounds. This specifies the number of samples to skip 
+when starting to play a sound. The Flash file format specification reports that 
+this attribute is only encoded when a streaming sound is encoded using the MP3 
+format. However it appears that the attribute is actually optional - presumably 
+if the latency is zero then the attribute can be omitted.
+
+The FSSoundStreamHead and FSSoundStreamHead2 classes have been updated to 
+handle the optional cases.
+
+9861. Cannot decode Gradient Fills with more than 8 Gradients.
+
+The FSGradientFill class allows up to 8 FSGradient points to be defined. The 
+number of gradients is stored in a single byte when an FSGradientFill object is 
+encoded. In some files generated using Flash 7+ the upper bits of the byte are 
+set. The result is that the FSGradientFill class decodes more than the maximum 
+number of 8 gradients and an FSCoderException is thrown indicating an overflow 
+error.
+
+The FSGradientFill class now masks the upper four bits of the gradient fill 
+count. It also tests to see if the value is greater than 8 and subtracts 8 to 
+generate the correct number of gradient points.
