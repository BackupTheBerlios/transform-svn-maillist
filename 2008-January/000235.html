+----------------------------------------------------------
+  Release Notes for Transform SWF for Java, Version 2.2.
+----------------------------------------------------------
+
+The release adds new classes to make it easier to construct movies and get 
+information about flash file. New methods are added to JPEG images to get 
+width and height.
+
+
+Bug Fixes
+    FSColorTransform method isUnityTransform is now correctly spelled.
+    Trailing null byte is now removed from password string in FSProtect.
+
+Class Changes
+    JPEG Images have width and height.
+    FSShapeConstructor - polygon() now handles absolute coordinates.
+    FSFrame - a new class for organising the time-line within movies.
+    FSLayer - a new class for organising the animation of objects within movies.
+    FSHeader - a new class for just getting information about a flash file.
+    
+Documentation Changes
+    FSPlaceObject2 - corrected documentation on setting the morph ratio.
+
+Testing Changes
+    None scheduled
+    
+Package Changes
+    None scheduled
+
+  
+-------------
+  Bug Fixes  
+-------------
+
+1. FSColorTransform method isUnityTransform is now correctly spelled.
+
+In previous releases the 't' was missing from 'Unity' i.e. isUniyTransform. This 
+is now corrected to isUnityTransform.
+
+2. Trailing null byte is now removed from password string in FSProtect.
+
+If the password string in FSProtect contained a trailing null byte marking the
+end of the string then it was included in the string when it was decoded using 
+the UTF-8 character set. The null byte is no longer included.
+
+-----------------
+  Class Changes  
+-----------------
+
+1. JPEG Images have width and height.
+
+Accessor methods to get the width and height of a JPEG encoded image are 
+added to the FSDefineJPEGImage, FSDefineJPEGImage2 and FSDefineJPEGImage3
+classes.
+
+    public int getWidth();
+    public int getHeight();
+
+No set methods are added, the width and height are decoded from the image data 
+whenver the object is decoded or the setImage() method is used.
+
+2. FSShapeConstructor - polygon() now handles absolute coordinates.
+
+The coordinates passed to the polygon(int[]) method on FSShapeConstructor are 
+now absolute. A new method rpolygon(int[]) was added to allow polygons to be 
+drawn using relative coordinates.
+
+3. FSFrame - a new class for organising the time-line within movies.
+
+FSFrame is an upgraded version of the Frame class currently available on the 
+Useful Code page with the addition of a frame number attribute. 
+
+Grouping together all the objects associated with a frame simplifies greatly the 
+task of creation and editing a movie. However supported numbered frames becomes
+really useful when combined with the new FSLayer class.
+
+4. FSLayer - a new class for organising the animation of objects within movies.
+
+Currently all the objects must be created and positioned for successive frames.
+This makes creating of complex animations with Transform next to impossible 
+without careful coding.
+
+With the FSLayer class, separate time-lines can be created for each object. With
+each frame numbered using the FSFrame class all the layers can easily be aligned 
+and flattened to create the final animation. 
+
+5. FSHeader - a new class for just getting information about a flash file.
+
+FSHeader decodes the header block of a flash file that contains the following 
+information about a movie:
+
+    signature, indicates whether a file was compressed &quot;CWS&quot; or not &quot;FWS&quot;.
+	version, the version of Flash used.
+	length, the length of the movie in bytes when uncompressed.
+ 	minX, the x-coordinate of the top left corner of the screen.
+ 	maxX, the x-coordinate of the bottom right corner of the screen.
+ 	minY, the y-coordinate of the top left corner of the screen.
+ 	maxY, the y-coordinate of the bottom right corner of the screen.
+ 	frameRate, the rate at which the movie is played, in frames per second.
+ 	frameCount, the number of frames in the movie.
+ 	
+FSHeader only the header information is decoded, the rest of the data structures 
+are ignored so the class can be used to get the attributes of a movie without
+paying the penalty of using FSMovie where all the data structures are decoded.
+
+-------------------------
+  Documentation Changes  
+-------------------------
+
+1. FSPlaceObject2 - corrected documentation on setting the morph ratio.
+
+The javadoc comments on methods that set the morph ratio for an object specified
+the range as 0..65535, this is the actual number encoded in the Flash file 
+however Transform uses a floating point value in the range 0..1 which is more 
+intuitive to use - the value in converted when the object is encoded or decoded.
+The documentation was updated to refer to the floating point range. 
+

+  Testing Changes

+None
